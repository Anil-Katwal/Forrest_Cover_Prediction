## 🧠 About the Project:
Forests are critical for climate regulation, biodiversity, and human livelihood. Accurately identifying forest cover types from geographical and environmental features enables better land use planning and conservation strategies.

This app leverages a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict forest cover types from user-provided features and presents:

📊 ML-powered predictions

🌿 Detailed ecological insights

🖼️ Forest-type-specific imagery

⚡ Interactive UI built with Streamlit

## 🌍 Cover Types Predicted:
